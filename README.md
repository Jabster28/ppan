A open-source Rust version of the web game [Paddle Force](https://flobotron.itch.io/paddle-force). Most likely never going to be complete, but who knows.

## Plans
- [ ] Online Play
    - [ ] Server-based, P2P optional (but made obvious cause IP) with holepunching
    - [ ] Rollback netcode, makes lag even and removes it most times
    - [ ] Ranked mode? Probably use Glicko 2
- [ ] Cosmetics
    - [ ] Pretty much everything from most AAA games just to flex.
    - [ ] Custom paddle and area textures, board border and ball textures random like PUBG
    - [ ] Maybe some goal anims, like rocket league?
- [ ] Local Multiplayer
    - [ ] Easily changeable controls, with some defaults
    - [ ] When in local, allow basic colour skins for differentiation / maybe labels
    - [ ] Handicaps cause some people are just trash
